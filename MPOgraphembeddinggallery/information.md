Here, we post images obtained from limit induced MPO graph embeddings. We observe that limit induced MPO graph embeddings are not designed for image processing; unlike CNNs, limit induced MPO graph embeddings do not take into account the ordering or the distance between rows or columns of pixels. Instead, these images show that the gradient ascent for the limit induced MPO graph embeddings.

Suppose that $(\{1,\dots,n\},E)$ is an undirected graph. Then we can represent the limit induced MPO graph pre-embedding $f$ of $V$ by the heatmap of the function $g:\{\1,\dots,n\\}^2\rightarrow \[0,\infty)$ where $g(a,b)=\rho(f(a)f(b))$. Suppose that $(\{1,\dots,m\},\{1,\dots,n\},E)$ is an undirected bipartite graph. Then we can represent the limit induced MPO graph pre-embedding $f$ of $V$ by the heatmap of the function $g:\{\1,\dots,m\\}\times\\{1,\dots,n\\}\rightarrow \[0,\infty)$ where $g(a,b)=\rho(f(a)f(b))$.

We also observe that some images are easy for limit induced MPO graph embeddings to learn; for example, the graph $(\\{1,\dots,n\\},E)$ where $E=\\{(x,y)\in\\{1,\dots,n\\}^2\mid \sin((x^2+y^2)/r)>0\\}$ is easy for a limit induced MPO graph embedding to recognize since the gradient ascent algorithm learns to constructively interfere on the set $E$ and as a consequence, the gradient ascent algorithm also destructively interferes on the set $\\{1,\dots,n\\}^2\setminus E.$
